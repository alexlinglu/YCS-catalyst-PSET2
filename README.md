# Pset 2: CSS/JS Obstacle Course

Welcome to your second Catalyst PSET! For this assignment, we'll be honing our CSS and JS skills.

## Getting Started

First, `git clone` this GitHub repository and open it up in VSCode or whichever code editor you prefer.

## Instructions

Your job is to follow the directions in `index.html`, adding styling and functionality to the page.

However, you may NOT modify `index.html`. You may ONLY modify `index.css` and `index.js`.

Good luck!

## Submission

Please make a screen recording through Zoom or any other screen-recording application of your choice. Walk us through both the code you wrote for this project as well as the visual output. Upload this video walkthrough to a video sharing service of your choice (unlisted YouTube video, Google Drive, etc.) and submit the share link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedtqyx1ZP_3-FRuzycK_WIxDu1uQ8-n-E0pE3a1CaT7lSJzg/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is all you have to do for the submission!
